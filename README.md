# Finance Companion

**Deployed site**: <add a link to your deployment here, if you create one>

## Overview
Many young adults, especially first-generation students and immigrants, face challenges in managing personal finances due to: limited exposure to budgeting, credit, and investment strategies, lack of accessible financial education, and/or overwhelming or inaccessible financial news and advice. Even beyond these groups, most people struggle to build sustainable wealth due to poor financial habits, limited tools, or unclear financial information.
