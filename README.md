**Deployed site**: [Finance Companion](https://finance-companion-frontend.onrender.com/)

## Overview
Many young adults, especially from first-generation, low-income, and/or immigrant backgrounds, face challenges in managing personal finances due to: limited exposure to budgeting, credit, and investment strategies, lack of accessible financial education, and/or overwhelming or inaccessible financial news and advice. Even beyond these groups, most people struggle to build sustainable wealth due to poor financial habits, limited tools, or unclear financial information. . Finance Companion addresses these challenges by offering a personalized budget page for smart money allocation, an annotated news page that simplifies complex financial articles, and a learning page with accessible resources to build long-term financial literacy.
