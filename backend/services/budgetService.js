 * This budget logic is based on the 50/30/20 rule, but adjusts based on income.
 * Itâ€™s designed to be flexible and realistic by giving users a budget that fits
 * their situation while still encouraging good financial habits.
 *
 * - When income goes up: needs take up less of the budget, wants get a bit more,
 *   and savings naturally grow.
 *
 * - When income goes down: needs take up more, wants are still protected with a
 *   small minimum, and savings get a small boost to help users build stability
 *   even if money is tight.
